            <p>
                I'm <strong>Scott Gordon</strong>, a Professor of Information Technology and Cybersecurity 
                at <a href=https://www.middlesex.edu/index.html>Middlesex Community College</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Professor, I teach foundational and advanced IT concepts, helping students develop practical technical skills. 
                I design and deliver curriculum that covers areas such as networking, scripting, database management, and cybersecurity.
                In addition to classroom instruction, I'm also involved in various campus activities and organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I very much enjoy my current role as a Professor, my passion is in computer programming and software engineering.
                My professional experience with software development is limited, 
                though it was an important part of my role as a <a href=./experience.html#data_analyst>Data Analyst</a>.
                You can also check out my ongoing and past software <a href=./projects.html>projects</a> for more context on my background in software.
